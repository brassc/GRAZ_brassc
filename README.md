# Input: brain data, same as in \BRAIN
Uniaxial tension/compression and simple shear data for the cortext, corona radiata, corpus callosum, basal ganglia.

# Instructions
1. Download `input` folder and `BrainCANN.ipynb` and upload them to your Google Drive account
2. Change the `path` variable in the third code block to direct to where you put these files
3. Run the code blocks sequentially

# Debugging Common Issues
1. Make sure you are using the correct matplotlib and tensorflow versions by running the second code block where you can check the versions.
2. Make sure all the code blocks have been checked; missing one would prevent the code from running.
